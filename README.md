#Terraform-aws-apigateway HTTP API/WebSocket

Amazon API Gateway is an AWS service for creating, publishing, maintaining, monitoring, and securing REST, HTTP, and WebSocket APIs at any scale.

HTTP APIs enable you to create RESTful APIs with lower latency and are designed with minimal features so that they can be offered at a lower price than it's REST APIs alternative which support more features such as API keys, per-client throttling, request validation, AWS WAF integration, or private API endpoints (use HTTP APIs if you don't need these features)
